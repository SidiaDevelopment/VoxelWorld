# VoxelWorld
Training Unity on a Voxel World

I have created this project to train different aspects of Unity.
I am familiar with Unity itself, most of its features and its workflows.

My first goal was learning about terrain generation, it lead to some problems which I solved mostly. 
I decided for a minecraft "clone" style because that way I have a clear path of features and I can fully focus on the programming part.

This project is not meant for release. It's sole purpose is learning. 

## Goals
 - Terrain Generation: Done, reworking code
 - Player movement: Done
 - Player interactions: Partly done
 - Inventory: Done
 - Voxel interaction in live-time: Not yet started
 - Character setup: Not yet started
 
I set new goals once I reach already listed goals and when I discover interesting topics.
